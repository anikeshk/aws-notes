- [[Amazon Virtual Private Cloud]]
	- VPC Wizard
	- Default VPC is created at account creation; for testing not for prod
	- “logically separated” section of the AWS Cloud
- Subnets
	- Belong to an availability zone
	- Can be public or private
- IP addressing
	- When you create a VPC you assign it to an IPv4 CIDR block (IPv6 is also supported)
	- Cannot change the address range after you create the VPC
	- largest IPv4 CIDR block size is /16; smallest IPv4 CIDR block size is /28
	- CIDR blocks of subnets cannot overlap in one VPC
- Subnets
	- Reserved IP address
	- ![[Pasted image 20240531200819.png]]
	- Private IP address is automatically assign
	- Public IP address can be manually assigned or automatically assigned using auto-assign settings
	- Elastic IP address
		- Associated with an AWS account
		- Can be allocated and remapped anytime
- Elastic network interface (ENI)
	- Is a virtual network interface that you can attach to an instance
	- Attributes follow when it is reattached to a new instance
	- Each instance in your VPC has a default network interface
	- Cannot detach the primary default ENI; can attach additional ENIs
- Route tables and routes
	- Set of rules or routes that you can configure to direct network traffic from your subnet
	- By default, every route table contains a local route for communication within the VPC
	- Each subnet must be associated with a route table
	- Default route table cannot be changed; new rules can be added
	- One subnet → one route table; one route table can have multiple subnets associated
- Internet Gateways
	- Route public internet traffic to/from VPC
- Network Address Translation (NAT) Gateway
	- Allows private subnet to communicate with public internet
- Network ACLs
	- Subnet level
	- Default: allow all inbound and outbound IPv4 traffic
	- Are stateless
- Security Groups
	- Virtual firewall for inbound/outbound traffic rules
	- Instance level
	- Default: allow all outbound IPv4 traffic and deny all inbound IPv4
	- Are stateful
