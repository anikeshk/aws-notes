	- AMI / Amazon Machine Image
		- AWS Region specific
	- Launch Instance Wizard (nine key decisions)
		- AMI (4 choices: Quick Start, My AMIs, AWS Marketplace, Community AMIs)
		- Instance type (determines: memory, processing  power, disk space and disk type, network performance, GPUs?; five categories)
		- Network settings (VPC, subnet, public IP address?)
		- IAM role 
		- User data (by default script executes the first time the instance starts)
		- Storage options (Amazon EBS, Amazon EC2 Instance Store, Amazon EFS, connect to Amazon S3)
		- Tags
		- Security group
		- Key pair
	- Amazon EC2 instance lifecycle
		- Launch → Pending → Running <→ Rebooting
		- Running → Stopping → Stopped
		- Running → Shutting-down → Terminated
	- When an instance is stopped and then started again: The public IPv4 address and external DNS hostname will change. Elastic IP address can be used for persistent public IPv4 address.
	- Instance metadata
		- `curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data` or /user-data
- Amazon EC2 Cost Optimization
	- Different pricing models
		- For different workloads
		- ![[Pasted image 20240603234006.png]]
	- Four pillars of cost optimization
		- Right size
		- Increase elasticity
		- Optimize pricing model
		- Optimize storage choices

	- Kubernetes
- Amazon ECS
	- Amazon Elastic Container Service
	- Task definition (blueprint)
	- Do you want to manage the Amazon ECS cluster that runs the containers?
		- If yes, Amazon ECS cluster backed by Amazon EC2 (granular control)
		- If no, Amazon ECS cluster backed by AWS Fargate (easier to maintain, agile)
- Amazon EKS
	- Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service
	- Certified Kubernetes conformant
- Amazon ECR
	- Amazon Elastic Container Registry
- AWS Lambda
	- Serverless computing; event-driven
	- AWS Lambda event sources
		- Push: Amazon API Gateway
		- Poll: Amazon SQS
		- Invoke directly from console, AWS SDK, or AWS CLI
	- Function configuration: Function code, Dependencies, Execution role
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk
	- Managed service for web applications
